# Introduction
Throughout the history of cinema, women and men have both often been portrayed in stereotypical ways. 

Some common women stereotypes include the mother figure, the “femme fatale” and the damsel in distress. The mother figure is a stereotype where the female character is depicted as a caring and nurturing mother, and reinforces the idea that women’s primary role is to care for the children and the home. The “femme fatale” stereotype depicts female as seductive, manipulative and dangerous. The damsel in distress is probably also one of the most represented stereotypes in cinema. Often, the female is portrayed as weak and in need of rescue by a male hero, which reinforces the idea that women are helpless and need men to protect them. 

On the other hand, male characters also have their share of clichés. Some recurrent characters include the bad boy, the bachelor and so on. Some common male character attributes include being strong and athletic, violent and aggressive, competitive, intellectually gifted.

The portrayal of a gender in cinema can significantly impact how women and men are perceived and treated in society and thus reinforce gender stereotypes in real life. They can even contribute to oppression of the female gender. For example, roles where women are weak and dependent on men can make it more difficult for women to be seen as strong and independent, and can limit their opportunities and choices in life.

# Datasets

To study the representations of stereotypes in cinema, we will exploit the CMU movies summary dataset, which gathers various information on the actors, characters, and the pre-processed movie summaries. From these pre-processed summaries, we can gather valuable data on the actions done by characters, and associate these actions to male and female characters.

# Background stories
Madison is a 15-year-old girl who lives with her parents and older brother. She attends a competitive high school and is an honors student with a passion for acting. In her free time, Madison takes acting classes and auditions for local theater productions. She has also started to build a small portfolio of professional work, including a few small commercial and film roles. Madison is a confident young woman with a dream of becoming a successful actress.

Jack is a 16-year-old boy who has always dreamed of becoming an actor. He grew up in a small town, and from a young age he was drawn to the world of acting and storytelling. Jack began acting in school plays, and as he got older he started to take acting lessons and audition for professional roles. He has already appeared in a few independent films, and he is determined to continue working hard and building his skills in order to one day play in blockbuster movies. Jack is a passionate and talented young actor with a bright future ahead of him.

Which stereotypes will affect Jack and Madison during their acting career ? How will their gender impact the roles they will get to play? 

We will explore these questions in different settings: what if Madison and Jack were born in the sixties, in the nineties ? What if they work in India, USA, West Europe ?


# Tutorials...

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
