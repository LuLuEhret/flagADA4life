## Datasets 
To study the representations of stereotypes in cinema, we will exploit the CMU movies summary dataset, which gathers various information on the actors, characters, and the pre-processed movie summaries. From these pre-processed summaries, we can gather valuable data on the actions done by characters, and associate these actions to male and female characters.
